    <string name="desc_title">What is tattva?</string>
    <string name="desc">"Tattva is a Sanskrit word meaning ‘principle’, ‘reality’ or ‘truth’. According to various Indian schools of philosophy, a tattva is an element or aspect of reality conceived as an aspect of deity. Although the number of tattvas varies depending on the philosophical school, together they are thought to form the basis of all our experience.

Day is divided into five basic tattvas and it starts with Akāśa on every sunrise. Pṛithvī - earth, Jala – water, Tejas – fire, Vāyu – air and Akāśa – ether. These Tattvas change regularly in two-hour cycle. This means that the duration of one Tattva is 24 minutes. Each Tattva has a different color, shape and other properties. In each tattva something is appropriate or inappropriate to do.

Compliance tattvas leads to improved lifestyle habits and physical and mental health."</string>
